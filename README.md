# The Cute File Explorer (chfs) shared file system has a reflection cross-site scripting vulnerability

## Description:
Cute Http File Server (chfs) is a free, HTTP protocol file sharing server that can be accessed quickly using a browser.
Due to incorrect configuration, the hacker logs in to the chfs background using the default password and fails to verify the user input in the file search box. As a result, malicious data can be constructed to cause cross-site scripting attacks.
